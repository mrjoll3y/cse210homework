# Overview

I wanted to get a better understanding of C# by building a text-based adventure game. The goal was to learn how to apply object-oriented programming concepts like classes, methods, and inheritance while also getting comfortable with C# syntax.

The game takes the player through a series of choices, where they can battle, explore, and make decisions that affect the outcome of the story. Throughout this project, Iâ€™ve learned how to handle user input, use random numbers for game mechanics, and save data to a file for tracking player stats.

Overall, this project has helped me get better at using C# and apply it to something interactive.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code with the C# extension to write and run the program. .NET Core was used for compiling the code. The game was written in C#, using basic libraries for input/output, random number generation, and file handling.

The libraries used are:
- System: For basic functions like input and output.
- System.IO: To save player stats to a text file.

# Useful Websites

Here are some websites that helped me during the project:

- [C# Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)
- [C# Programming Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/)
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) (Great for getting answers to specific coding issues)

# Future Work

There are a few things I want to add or improve in the future:

- More enemies: Add different enemies and use inheritance to create different types.
- Expanded story: Add more branching paths and events to make it more interactive.
- Inventory system: Let the player pick up and use items in the game.
- Combat system improvements: Add special attacks and more options for combat.
- Save/load system: Allow players to save and load their progress.
