# Overview

I wanted to explore C # more and build a simple text-based adventure game. My main goal was to learn how to use object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts like classes and methods while getting a better feel for the language itself.

The game takes you through many choices, where you can fight battles, explore, and make decisions that change the story. Along the way, Iâ€™ve learned a lot about handling user input, using random numbers for game mechanics, and saving data to a file to track the player's stats.

Overall, this project has been a great way to practice C# , build something interactive, and learn how to apply it in a real-world scenario.

#Development Environment
To develop this, I used Visual Studio Code with the C# extension to write and run the code., and .NET Core to compile and run the program. The game was written entirely in C#, and I relied on a few libraries to help with the basics, like getting user input and generating random numbers.

The main libraries I used include:

System: For basic functionality like input and output.
System.IO: For saving stats to a text file.

Stack Overflow (Always helpful when I get stuck on something!)

#Future Work
There are a few things I want to improve and add to the game in the future:

1. More enemies: I want to add different kinds of enemies, and use inheritance to make them more varied.
2. Expanded story: Adding more paths and events to make the game even more engaging.
3. Inventory system: Let the player collect items and use them in the game.
